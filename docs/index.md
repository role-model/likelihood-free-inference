## Project Overview

This project explores likelihood-free inference methods for fitting parameters of the Rules of Life Engine Model, an agent-based simulation that predicts multiple aspects of biodiversity from first principles. Because the model is too complex to capture with equations, we train AI models to predict parameter values from patterns in data.
